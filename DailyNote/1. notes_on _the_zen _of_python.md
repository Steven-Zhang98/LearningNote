# Note on The Zen of Python (Xiyun's edition)

## English is better than Chinese (In Coding)

Google is better than Baidu. StackOverflow is better than CSDN (This is shit!!)

## Now is better than never.

## Beautiful is better than ugly.

Python 有非常简单的语法，能以简单并且接近自然语言的方式去写代码。

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
	if b > a:
		a, b = b ,a
	else:
		while b != 0:
			a,b = b , a% b
	return a
	
```

## Explicit is better than implicit.

在对变量命名时，更直观的变量名优于不直观的变量名，比如 [[Use of Binary to represent negative and floating point numbers#^5aacf6|decimal_num 就比 num 好]]

## Simple is better than complex.

比如说， [[2. binary#^34cdbc|判断一个数是否是偶数，利用& 1 计算就比 % 2 更好]]

## Complex is better than complicated.

当一篇文章很难理解，你要尽量用简单的方法去解释他

## Flat is better than nested.

这一点我们可以利用在笔记层级管理上，写 Binary 用一片文章去尽量解释清楚，就比单独把 Binary 作为一个文件夹，去创建很多文档再去解释 Binary 更好

## Sparse is better than dense.

为了提升代码可读性，通过换行符增加间隔以区别不同功能的代码块
## Readability counts.

可读性特别重要
## Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

遇到再特殊情况也不能破坏规则，比如保持简洁，比如先进行行动而不是什么都不做

## Although practicality beats purity.


## Errors should never pass silently.

## Unless explicitly silenced.

## In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

## There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

## Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

## Although never is often better than *right* now.

## If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

## If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

## Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
