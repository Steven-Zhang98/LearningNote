## What is stack

The Stack is a data structure that follows the first-in-last-out (LIFO) principle, similar to a stack of plates or ammunition in the magazine.  The last added element will be the first to be removed from the structure.

An array and linked list can implement the stack. So, the stack describes the logical relationship of how the elements are added and removed.

The way we use stack is like loading ammunition into the magazine. When we push an element in the stack, it is like adding ammunition to the magazine. When we pop an element, it is like firing bullets from a magazine.
