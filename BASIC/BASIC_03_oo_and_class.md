```python
dog_name = "dog1"
dog_position = [1,1]
print(dog_name, "born at position", dog_position)
new_position = [1,3]
print(dog_name, "moved from", dog_position,"to position", new_position)

dog_name = "dog2"
dog_position = [1,1]
print(dog_name, "born at position", dog_position)
new_position = [1,4]
print(dog_name, "moved from", dog_position,"to position", new_position)
```

This code creates two dogs on the game map. I set their names and positions at the beginning and can later move them to different positions.

Because dog 1 and dog 2 use the same variable dog_name and dog_position, when we create dog 2, the dog_name and dog_position will change from dog 1's name and position and dog'2 name and position. This is called variable reuse. But if we reuse the variable, The position updates and the movements of the dogs can not be interactive.

To make this code more dynamic and capable of handling multiple dogs without overwriting, one approach could be to use a list or a dictionary to store each dog's details.

```python
dog1 = {"name": "dog1", "position": [1, 2]}
print(dog1["name"])
dog2 = {"name": "dog2", "position": [1, 4]}
dog = [dog1,dog2]
print(dog[0]["name"],"bron at" ,dog[0]["position"])
dog[0]["position"] = [3,4]
print(dog[0]["name"],"bron at" ,dog[0]["position"],"move to",dog[0]["position"])

```

I find it hard to add new users to the user_list; I have to input the name, age, and bio in a dictionary and add the dictionary to the user_list. And i also find it hard for me to input some new information into the dictionary, for example, i want to add the (a person's) height.
So I think i can create a user class, it is very convenient for me to add new information into the class.

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, age, bio, height=None):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.bio = bio
        self.height = height

    def update_height(self, new_height):
        self.height = new_height

# Creating a user
user1 = User("fanfan", 24, "bio")

# Adding a new user
user_list = [user1]
user2 = User("newuser", 30, "new bio")
user_list.append(user2)

# Updating user information
user1.update_height(170)

```
