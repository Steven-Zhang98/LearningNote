## Why i want to study computer science

I want to talk about the reason why we study computer science, then talk about the way i study computer science.

 "Open source", when you have an project , then you want to improve your project ,the best way to do it is open source, there are two reasons , first, when you try to explain an new concept to anybody ,and help then solve their problem ,you will know more about the new concept. 

And the second reason is "Version Control" ,as we all known the hardest part of we want to try anything new is the first step. As i learned more about version control, I realized the fastest way to learn anything new is try to make a *prototype* as quick as possible.
