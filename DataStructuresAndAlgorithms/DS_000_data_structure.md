## Logical structure and Physical structure

The logical structure shows the relationship between the elements in the data structure. In linear data structures, such as arrays and linked lists, data are arranged in a specific sequence, signifying one-to-one relationships. Conversely, elements like trees and graphs are organised in a hierarchical or network manner in non-linear data structures, representing one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. This classification helps in understanding how data interacts within the structure. 

The physical structure shows how the data is stored in computer memory. It is helpful for programmers to know the usage of memory. Contiguous memory space. Scatter memory space
