# 交互式学习

## Basic

### Base LLM

- predicts

- training data

### Instruction Tuned LLM

## Write clear and specific instructions 

### Use delimiters

- """

	- triple quotes

- '''

	- triple backticks

- ---

	- triple dashes

- <>

	- angle brakets

- <tag></tag>

- seperate the text and the prompt and the format

### ask for structured output

- JSON 格式

- Markdown 格式

- Cite the answer accurately

### check assumptions required to do the task

### "Few-shot" prompting

## Give the model time to “think”

### Specify the steps required to complete a task

###  Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

- using a chain of thought reasoning, break down the problem into smaller, interconnected problems, and identify potential solutions for each problem.

## Model Limitations: Hallucinations

## iterative prompt development

### the process to develop prompt

- try something

- Analyze where the result does not give what you want

- clarify instructions

## Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks

## Provide reference text

## 用 GPT 探索新事物

### 建立学习目标和计划

### 学习推理过程

- Using a chain of thought reasoning, break down the problem into smaller, interconnected problems

### 主动重构寻求反馈与总结

- 利用 gpt 进行模拟面试

- 代码重构

### 结合learning zone

- how to learn from prompt

	- 记录和应用笔记

		- 利用 Anki 进行复习

- 如何利用 gpt，在我已知知识基础之上，给我解释新概念

### learning method prompt

- 1. Integrated Code Explanation: Combining 'Code Line Explanation', 'Code Chunking', and 'Metaphor Creation' into a cohesive process. Initially, the GPT provides detailed explanations for each line of code. 

	- 2. Then, it organizes related lines into logical blocks and uses metaphors to elucidate complex concepts, aiding multi-faceted understanding.

- 3. Interactive Self-Explanation

	- : Following the integrated code explanation, users are encouraged to explain the code in their own words. After users submit their explanations, the GPT offers feedback, correcting misunderstandings and adding extra information.

- 4. Conceptual Connection and User Feedback: 

	- The GPT guides users to explore connections between the code and broader programming concepts, inviting discussion. Based on the user's responses, the GPT provides insights and feedback.

- 5. Code Exploration and Modification:

	-  Users are encouraged to modify and experiment with the code to deepen their understanding, with the GPT evaluating their modifications and providing feedback.

- 6. Interleaving Technique Application

	- : Different learning techniques, like problem-solving, case studies, or programming challenges, are introduced to reinforce understanding.

- 7.Customized Quizzes and Self-Evaluation

	- : GPT creates quizzes that reflect the user’s learning progress. These quizzes help in self-evaluation and understanding the depth of the learned content.

- 8. Real-World Application Scenario

	- : Practical programming scenarios are presented for users to apply their learning to real-world problems.

- 9. GPT-Assisted Summary and Feedback:

	- GPT helps users summarize their learning and provides comprehensive feedback on their understanding and areas for improvement

- 10. Learning Aids Creation

	- : Finally, flashcards and visual aids are created based on the user's knowledge gaps to enhance learning.
